## Simple code to run SCENIC on your single cell data

The fundamental bug plus of single cell seq experiments is exploring the heterogeneity of a biological sample. 
This is particularly interesting (I think) if you are focusing on a single tissue type as it undergoes change
This might be cells in a developing tissue, in culture or cells in a disease process (maybe compared to normal tissue)

When you are doing the above, scRNAsq is essentially showing you the various _transcriptional states_ of a tissue. 
How many states exist within your sample is a tricky question, and kind of centres around some sort of combination
of how diverse the sample actually is, combined with your clustering resolution and how confident you are that each
cluster you annotate as a seperate state/type is actually that. My boss always says you should be able to stand up 
in court and justify that they are truly different.
